STRINGS IN JAVA:
- Every String you create is actually an OBJECT of type STRING
- Even String constant are actually STRING OBJECTS
    - e.g. "System.out.println("This is a string, too");"
    * "This is a String, too" is a STRING OBJECTS
- OBJECTS of type STRING are IMMUTABLE
    - Once a String OBJECT is created, its content cannot be altered
    - This is NOT a restriction because:
        1. If you need to change a string, you can always create a new one that
           contains the modification
        2. Java defines peer classes of String, called "StringBuffer" and
           "StringBuilder", which allow strings to be altered, so all of the normal
           string manipulations are sill available in Java
- Strings can be constructed in a variety of ways
    * String mystring = "this is a test";
