Control statement to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes
to the state of a program
JAVA's program control statements can be put into 3 categories:
- SELECTION
    * Allow programs to choose different paths
    * (if, ternary, switch)
- ITERATION
    * Enable program execution to repeat one or more statements
    * Loops (for, do-while, while)
- JUMP
    * Allows your program to execute in a nonlinear fashion
