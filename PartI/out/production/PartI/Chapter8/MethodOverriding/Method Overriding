*   In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the SAME NAME and TYPE
    SIGNATURE as a METHODS in it SUPERCLASS, then the method in the subclass is said
    to "OVERRIDE" the METHOD in the SUPERCLASS.
*   When an overridden method is called from within its SUBCLASS, it will always
    refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass.
        - The version of the method defined by the SUPERCLASS will be hidden
*   Method overriding occurs only when the NAMES and the SIGNATURES of the two
    METHODS are IDENTICAL.
        - If they ARE NOT, then the two methods are simply overloaded
* OVERRIDING === "NAME HIDING"
