INHERITANCE
* One of the cornerstones of OOP
* Allows the creation of hierarchical classifications
* You can create general class that defines traits common
  to a set of related items
* In terminology of Java:
    1. SUPERCLASS: class that is inherited
    2. SUBCLASS: class that does the inheriting (specialized version of a SUPERCLASS)
* To inherit a class, you simply incorporate the definition of one class into another by using EXTENDS
