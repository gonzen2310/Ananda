* Java includes a feature that simplifies the creation of methods the need to take a
variable number of arguments ==> varargs (variable-length arguments)
* A METHOD that takes a VARIABLE NUMBER of arguments is call a VARIABLE-ARITY METHOD
or simple VARARGS METHOD
* Situation that require that a variable number of arguments be passes to a METHOD:
    - METHOD that opens anInternet connection (name, passwrd, filename, protocols, etc)
        * Would be convenient to pass only arguments to which the default did not apply
    - printf() method
* PREVIOUS ALTERNATIVES TO VARARGS:
    - Method overloading (For narrow situations)
    - Passing argument through an array (Tedious process / Error-prone)
