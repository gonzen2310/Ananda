- Sometimes you want to pass information into a program when you run it
- This is accomplished by passing COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS to main().
- A CLA is the information that directly follows the program's name on the command line
when it is executed
- To access the CMA inside a Java program is quite easy => They are stored as STRINGS
  in a STRING ARRAY passed to args parameter of main()
