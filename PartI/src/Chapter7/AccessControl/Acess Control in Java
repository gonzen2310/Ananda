ENCAPSULATION
- Links DATA with the CODE that manipulates it.
- However, it provides another important attribute: ACCESS CONTROL
- You can control what parts of a program can ACCESS the members of a class
    - This prevents misuse of that data

- When correctly implemented, a class create a "BLACK BOX" which may be used, but
  the inner workings of which are not open to tampering

ACCESS MODIFIERS:
- Determines how a member can be accessed
- PACKAGE: Grouping of CLASSES
- Java's access modifiers: PUBLIC - PRIVATE - PROTECTED(Inheritance) - DEFAULT ACCESS
* PUBLIC:
    - The member can be accessed by any other code
    - E.g. main()
* PRIVATE:
    - The member can only be accessed by other members of ITS class
!! WHEN NO ACCESS MODIFIER IS USED, THEN BY DEFAULT THE MEMBER OF A CLASS IS PUBLIC
WITHIN ITS OWN "PACKAGE", BUT CANNOT BE ACCESS OUTSIDE ITS PACKAGE"

- Usually you want to restrict access to the data member of a class - Allowing access
  only through methods
- ACCESS MODIFIERS must precede the rest of a member's type specification.
