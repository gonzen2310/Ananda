ARRAYS are implemented as OBJECTS
    - Because of this, there is a special array attribute that you will want
      to take advantage of ==> array.length;

IMPORTANT: The value of "length" has nothing to do with the number of elements
that are actually in ue. It only reflects the number of elements that the array
is designed to hold.
