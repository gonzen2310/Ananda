// REMINDER
/*
 * break was not designed to provide the normal means by which a loop is
   terminated. The loopâ€™s conditional expression serves this purpose
 * The break statement should be used to cancel a
   loop only when some sort of special situation occurs.
 */

// IMPORTANT
/*
 * When used inside a set of nested loops, the break statement will only
 * break out of the innermost loop
 */
