WHY OVERRIDDEN METHODS?

* Overridden methods allow Java to support run-time POLYMORPHISM
* POLYMORPHISM is essential to OOP for one reason:
    ALLOWS A GENERAL CLASS TO SPECIFY METHODS THAT WILL BE COMMON TO
    ALL OF ITS DERIVATIVES, WHILE ALLOWING SUBCLASSES TO DEFINE THE
    SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OR ALL OF THOSE METHODS.
* Overridden methods are another way that Java implements the "one interface,
  multiple methods"
* Key to understand POLYMORPHISM: Superclasses and subclasses form a HIERARCHY
  which moves from lesser to greater specialization. Used correctly, a SUPERCLASS:
    * Provides all elements that a subclass can use directly.
    * Defines those METHODS that the derived class must implement on its own.
        - This allows the SUBCLASS the flexibility to define its own METHODS, yet
          still enforces a consistent interface
* Thus, by combining INHERITANCE with OVERRIDDEN methods, a superclass can define
  the general form of the methods that will be used by all of its subclasses
