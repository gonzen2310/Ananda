WHEN CONSTRUCTORS ARE EXECUTED?

- When a class hierarchy is created, in what order are the constructors for the
  classes that make up the hierarchy executed? For example, given a subclass
  called B and a superclass called A, is A's constructor executed before B's, or
  vice versa?
  * In a class hierarchy, CONSTRUCTORS complete their execution in ORDER OF
    DERIVATION --> From SUPERCLASS to SUBCLASS
  * Since super() must be the first statement executed in a SUBCLASS' constructor,
    this order is the same whether or not super() is used.
        * If super() is not used, then the default or parameterless
          constructor of each SUPERCLASS will be executed
