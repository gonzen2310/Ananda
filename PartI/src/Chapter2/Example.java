// PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND NOTES
/*
 * Source file is called "compilation unit"
 * The name you give to your source file is VERY important
 * In Java all code must reside inside a class
 * By convention the name of the CLASS should match the name of the file that holds
 * the class name (Java is case-sensitive)
 * Console output and input are not used frequently in most real-world Java applications
 * Since most modern computing environment are windowed and graphical in nature
 * However, console I/O is used mostly for:
        * simple utility programs
        * demonstration programs
        * and server-side code
